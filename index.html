                                 Hii! I am the real person who knows about this useless and uninteresting person. Do you know who he is? He means no one new, but just the mad author of this content. I think I was the person in whom he had the greatest depth of truth, I think so.I've been with him for almost a year. Before me,my place in his life was totally occupied by someone else whom I hadn’t seen till now. We are usually the ones who do not meet on a regular or infrequent basis. But he tells me when he feels high or low, or when he feels something inside him.
                                 <br><br>
                                 In recent days,he was just a person who had nothing special in his life. He hadn’t made his life more interesting, and our conversion hasn’t gone well. The one thing I need to say now is that he mentioned some of his fortune characters in his life, who made him to feel fulfill . They are not just characters to him. They may be characters like Ramesh or Suresh from "Five-Star Charater cambos", But some of them make him feel better. He also has people with personalities like rowdies and some bajaries in his life.When we met recently,he had no aura in his face and nothing to share as special with me. During our conversion, he got flooded with the thought of some other things and just left me aside and went on searching for someone who he had to meet, I think so.I eagerly wait to see who he is searching for.
                              </p>
                              <br>
                              <p>He had finally found her and welcomed her near to me,but now he was not in the mood to look at me. I have noticed that there are some cute and happy expressions in his face that I haven’t seen in recent days but that I had seen at the beginning of our relationship. Then I understood that she was his ex. He had shared everything with her until their relationship came to an end. While he is seeing her,I have focused on them entirely and am starting to read his mind.
                                 <br>
                                 <br>
                                 They are happy to share their old memories, which they can’t bring back. I haven't seen him like this before. Then I gave them some space but did not take my eyes or ears from them. They laughed, cried, and comforted each other. She holds his tears on his hands. He wipes her tears. The bond of love between them was not explainable. It looks good, and it has given me proof of his happiest days. Later, he allowed her to leave and gave her a warm sendoff by walking with her for a while. I noticed he is not the person now who left me here before. Something has changed him beyond what I can offer him.

                              <br>
                            <p>Then he noticed me! He wipes his tears from his eyes secretly. He came near to me and had a pleasant smile on his face, which is something that was in his face. He started to speak with me. He expressed how happy he was at that moment. At last, he says that he was fulfilled with what he had with him then. He told me that the people who broke up with each other did not actually mean it. They had left each other for their well, but that did not mean the end of their relationship. They have only each other as witnesses and a roflumilast drug to recall all their memories of the past. He also mentioned that the present me is very important to him to engrave the whole him, and by now he was on my shoulder and taking a relaxing nap.</p>
                             <br>
                             <p>Then I realized how  fond and worried he was of his present. After seeing all this,I can assure you that he is not a person who disrespects others or who has an attitude toward him. I accept that he may have some difficulty facing something or someone at first. But it was not his behavior or nature. Just approach him and give him some space; then you will understand who he really is. I can’t assure you how long I'm going to be with him. I'm going to leave him once I've completed my mission. Even he physically but not mentally. The common wish that we have is that these days we want to go as far as possible, and I need to give him more space to know more about him. I am really waiting for our next meeting.</p>

                             <p>You are very pleasant hearted person who have listened all my useless words about this unworthy person.Are you know who am I…?  or Are you aware of who was she I have spoke about..? Any Guesses…..? Yes I am his Diary and she was the one which he uses before I.</p>
                             <br> 
                             <p>Have you ever thought ,How it seems when your diary speaks? This may like a jokee to hear.Have you ever realize how it express its feel about you.It always interesting to hear when someone speaks about you.Just have a habbit of making the note of important moments of your present life.I may be a treasurer to your past.The thing I have said in above as a words of my diary may creatively romanticize,overemphasized or blowed-down.But the meaning behind the words is true.</p>
